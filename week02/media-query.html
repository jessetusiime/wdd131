            <p>And again, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you concerning hope. How is it that ye can attain unto
                faith, save ye
                shall have hope?</p>

            <h2>Alma 4:4</h2>
            <p>And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many were baptized in the waters of Sidon and
                were joined to
                the church of God; yea, they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been consecrated the high priest
                over the people
                of the church, by the hand of his father Alma.</p>
